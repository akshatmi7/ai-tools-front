  <h2>üß† What is This?</h2>
  <p>This is an <strong>AI-powered digit recognition app</strong>, where you can <strong>draw any digit (0-9)</strong> on a canvas, and the app will predict what number you drew. It works completely in your web browser using <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> and AI models trained with your own data.</p>

  <h2>üöÄ How Does This Work?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Drawing the Number</strong><br>
      You draw a digit on the <strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>, which allows capturing your handwriting digitally.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Capturing the Image</strong><br>
      The app converts your drawing into a grayscale image and resizes it to a smaller, standard size (e.g., 28x28 pixels) ‚Äî like how handwritten digits are processed in popular datasets like MNIST.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Running AI Predictions</strong><br>
      The pre-trained <strong>AI Model</strong>, loaded using TensorFlow.js, processes your drawing and predicts the number you wrote.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</h2>
  <h3>‚úÖ TensorFlow.js</h3>
  <p>TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library developed by Google that allows you to run Machine Learning models <strong>directly in your browser</strong> or in Node.js without needing any backend server. With TensorFlow.js, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Train models in the browser.</li>
    <li>Run pre-trained models (like ours) with no installations required.</li>
    <li>Process images, audio, and text using AI.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>‚úÖ Teachable Machine</h3>
  <p>Teachable Machine is a <strong>no-code web tool by Google</strong> that lets you create machine learning models using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Sounds</li>
    <li>Poses</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Steps we followed using Teachable Machine:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Collected several images of hand-drawn digits by drawing them and taking screenshots.</li>
    <li>Uploaded those images to Teachable Machine.</li>
    <li>Assigned them to classes like <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, etc.</li>
    <li>Clicked "Train" to let Teachable Machine train a neural network using your images.</li>
    <li>Exported the model as a <strong>TensorFlow.js compatible model</strong>, including the <code>model.json</code> and weight files.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now, the AI model remembers how digits look like based on your training images, and predicts new inputs.</p>

  <h2>üîç What is TensorFlow?</h2>
  <p>TensorFlow is an <strong>open-source machine learning framework created by Google</strong>. It is widely used to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Train deep learning models</li>
    <li>Build AI solutions like image classification, text generation, and voice recognition</li>
    <li>Deploy models on servers, mobile apps, and now in the browser with TensorFlow.js</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üéØ How Did I Train the Model?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>I first drew digits (0-9) several times on a drawing app and took screenshots of each digit.</li>
    <li>I uploaded these images to Teachable Machine, creating classes for each digit.</li>
    <li>Teachable Machine automatically built and trained a neural network model, adjusting it to learn from my examples.</li>
    <li>Once trained, I exported the model for TensorFlow.js, which gave me a <code>model.json</code> file and some binary weight files.</li>
    <li>I placed these files in my Angular app's assets and loaded them using TensorFlow.js.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Why Train a Custom Model Instead of Using MNIST?</h2>
  <p>Popular datasets like MNIST contain standard handwritten digits, but they may not match your unique drawing style. By training your own model:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The model gets better at recognizing your handwriting.</li>
    <li>You can experiment with fewer training images.</li>
    <li>You learn how AI adapts to custom data.</li>
  </ul>
